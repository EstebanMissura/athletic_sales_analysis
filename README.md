Module 5 Challenge

Brief Description: In this challenge, I analyzed sales data to gain insights into which cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic wear over two years (2020 and 2021). I imported/ read csv files, checked out the dataframe specific info, combined both dataframes, checked for null values, and cleaned the data (ex. converting a variable to datetime type). Finally, I used groupby, pivot_table and resample to analyze the information and reach some conclusions. I determined which region sold the most products (Northeast), which region had the most sales (Northeast), which retailer had the most sales (West Gear), which retailer sold the most women's athletic footwear (West Gear), and what day and week had the most women's athletic footwear sales (2021-07-16 and 2021-12-19 respectively).
